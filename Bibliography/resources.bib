	Annotate = {The class of L1-regularized optimization problems has received much attention recently because of the introduction of ``compressed sensing,'' which allows images and signals to be reconstructed from small amounts of data. Despite this recent attention, many L1-regularized problems still remain difficult to solve, or require techniques that are very problem-specific. In this paper, we show that Bregman iteration can be used to solve a wide variety of constrained optimization problems. Using this technique, we propose a ``split Bregman'' method, which can solve a very broad class of L1- regularized problems. We apply this technique to the Rudin--Osher--Fatemi functional for image denoising and to a compressed sensing problem that arises in magnetic resonance imaging.},
