		This paper details an experiment which compares radial sampling with random sampling for image construction in compressive sensing and discovers that random sampling requires less data points to reconstruct the Shepp-Logan phantom image. It introduces the idea of applying compressive sensing to a signal that is sparse with respect to a basis and thus applies it to the gradient of the Shepp-Logan phantom image. In our research we will be testing a middle ground between the two sampling methods (random paths simulating robot paths). Also, we will be using the implementing the same idea of applying compressed sensing to the gradient of our constructed environment in order to reconstruct it.
