1. So I don't really even need html, I can just run a script on the server that
handles everything.

2. String time: time.ctime(time.time())

3. Permissions: The following command allowed me to write to the logs folder.

chmod a+w Logs/

ls -al allows you to see permissions

4. chmod 705 filename.cgi makes it executable

5. I wanted a form that submitted multiple fields in databaseManager. It
   didnâ€™t work when I used cgi.FieldStorage().getvalue(name). I had to
   store cgi.FieldStorage() in a variable and then get value from there.
   This is because the post request gets read all at once.


6. For MATLAB-MySQL, I looked at

http://www.courant.nyu.edu/~almgren/mysql/

I had to edit Matlab root/bin/mexopts.sh by changing all 10.7 to 10.9 for mac os


The path I used was different, I used:
mex -I/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/include -L/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/lib -lmysqlclient mysql.cpp

because that's where my mysql.h and libmysqlclient.a were (respectively).


I edited line 582 in mysql.cpp to add parentheses.


I added typedef uint16_t char16_t; before the include mex.h line in mysql.cpp

DIDN'T WORK IN THE END I GAVE UP.


7. Sending Get requests using arduino was easy.

    // String request = "GET " + repository + "Miscellaneous/helloWorld.cgi" + 
    //                  " HTTP/1.1\r\n" + "Host: " + ip + ":" + port + "\r\n";

Post, I haven't figured out yet, so I'm just sticking with get requests, since
my server side script doesn't care how the data comes into FieldStorage().

    // String request = "POST /projects/Robots14/robotServer.cgi HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    //                  "Host: 169.232.149.133:93\r\n"
    //                  "Cache-Control: max-age=0\r\n"
    //                  "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\r\n"
    //                  "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/35.0.1916.153 Safari/537.36\r\n"
    //                  "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n"
    //                  "Referer: http://169.232.149.133:93/projects/Robots14/robotServer.cgi\r\n"
    //                  "Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch\r\n"
    //                  "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\r\n"
    //                  "state=1&data=&submitdata=Submit\r\n";


    OR

        // String request = "POST "+ repository + "robotServer.cgi" + " HTTP/1.1\r\n"+
    //                   "Host: " + ip + ":" + port + "\r\n";// +
    //                   "state=2&data=&submitdata=Submit\r\n";


8. Found stuff on http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php/topic,188902.0.html
 to figure out how to read into array.s

8.5 MySql kept shutting down when starting up, so I went to Activity Monitor and
quit the process called mysqld.

9. Installed driver from 

    http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=229&pcid=41
to access Serial data. I used System Information -> USB -> USB Hub -> USB-Serial
Controller to identify it was Prolific 2303. Potential usefull info at

    http://forums.macrumors.com/archive/index.php/t-1086504.html

10. pySerial library was not installed to the right place; I was able to access
it from terminal but no IDLE. I added these lines to show it the path of the One
True Library

import sys
sys.path.append("/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/")


11. I had trouble deleting a database Log1, so I went to 

/Applications/XAMPP/var/mysql/data or something like that
and performed
sudo rm -rf Log1

and it worked.

12. VOLATILE THINGS: 

Network, Password, Security, IP, Port, System Path to Python, Serial port

13. Overcoming some problems:

I added a MAX_FAILS condition to the arduino, where if it couldn't connect to the server after
MAX_FAILS attempts, disconnect and reconnect to the internet.

14. Making the server capable of determining the farthest the robot can go in any particular
direction helped make the paths more random.

15. The server also checks that the location the video camera gives it is not the same as the
start location. This made the video tracking HELLA more accurate, now it actually requests the
server again for its position if the position the first time round was imprecise causing the 
server to respond "False" the first time round.

Bad data 5: 5, 6, 26, 27-34, 67, 68

Current issues with code: 

The theta that gets sent with state 0 is incorrect - it is the theta from before the robot turned
Possible fix: Change how you parse data 

Differing speeds of the robot as battery dies
Parallax - centre of the tag vs reflectance sensor actual position
serial takes a while


16. Camera firewire driver from: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/install.html

17. Downloaded Windows SDK to overcome link unable to include strmbase.lib error. Then went to folder samples->multimedia->directshow->baseclasses and built that solution as Release (NOT DEBUG). Included the folder and it compiled.

18. Crashes on starting. Still wants MSCRVP71.dll or something. Got the folder from desktop on old computer, copying files into same directory works

19. No runtime error, but closes. Still unable to start, cvcamInit() is not working.

20. Decided to implement in python. Use CMU driver to tune camera. Tuned at 188 Auto-Exposure, on Manual. Everything else same.

21. Use DCAM driver for python code.


22. Note on Globals

Say you've got a module like this:

# sample.py
myGlobal = 5

def func1():
    myGlobal = 42

def func2():
    print myGlobal

func1()
func2()
You might expecting this to print 42, but instead it prints 5. As has already been mentioned, if you add a 'global' declaration to func1(), then func2() will print 42.

def func1():
    global myGlobal
    myGlobal = 42
What's going on here is that Python assumes that any name that is assigned to, anywhere within a function, is local to that function unless explicitly told otherwise. If it is only reading from a name, and the name doesn't exist locally, it will try to look up the name in any containing scopes (e.g. the module's global scope).

When you assign 42 to the name myGlobal, therefore, Python creates a local variable that shadows the global variable of the same name. That local goes out of scope and is garbage-collected when func1() returns; meanwhile, func2() can never see anything other than the (unmodified) global name. Note that this namespace decision happens at compile time, not at runtime -- if you were to read the value of myGlobal inside func1() before you assign to it, you'd get an UnboundLocalError, because Python has already decided that it must be a local variable but it has not had any value associated with it yet. But by using the 'global' statement, you tell Python that it should look elsewhere for the name instead of assigning to it locally.


ESSENTIALLY, python can read anything from global namespaces, but if you create
or modify you need the keyword global.

23. Use task manager to close the pythonw.exe that uses ~30,000 K of memory to
stop the video tracker error.
