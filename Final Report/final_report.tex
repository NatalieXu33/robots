\title{Autonomous Robots and Environmental Mapping}

\begin{abstract}

In the field of signal processing, compressed sensing is a technique used for 
reconstructing sparse signals and images from very few samples and is commonly 
used in fMRIs and medical imaging. We aim to apply compressed sensing to allow 
autonomous robots to map an environment and identify areas of interest which 
are significantly different from the surrounding area. In our experiment, we 
program a robot equipped with a reflectance sensor to travel along several 
paths, do on-board summations of sensor readings, and send those sums (or path 
integrals) to a server. We then apply reconstruction algorithms to the data,  
which consists of the travelled paths and their integrals, to reconstruct the 
environment. Preliminary simulations of our experiment show faithful 
reconstruction of 100x100 images with only 100 data points (err. = 0.28) when 
using an adaptive pathing scheme, and our hardware is prepared to begin 
performing the proposed task.
